# chip8-emulator

This is my implementation of a [CHIP-8 Emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8 "CHIP8 Information").

Largely based off information provided [here](http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/ "How to write an emulator") by [Laurence Mulle](http://www.multigesture.net/about/ "Laurence Muller's Page").

Requirements:
	Requires that you have the [Simple Directmedia Layer](https://www.libsdl.org/ "SDL Website") installed.

###Example Usage
```
% chip8 ~/downloads/trip8.c8
```
